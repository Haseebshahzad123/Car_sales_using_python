The provided code performs an analysis of a car sales dataset.<br> It begins by importing necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Then, it loads the dataset from a CSV file named "Car_sales.csv".

The code proceeds with exploratory data analysis and data cleaning,<br> checking for missing values and dropping rows containing them. VIt examines the distribution of car manufacturers, visualizes sales trends, and identifies the top 10 most popular car models.

Finally, it generates visualizations to compare sales performance across different vehicle types and summarizes sales by manufacturer.

The project aims to uncover insights from the car sales data, such as popular models, sales trends, and factors influencing purchasing decisions.
